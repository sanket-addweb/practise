            and berries, dried mangos, fresh turmeric, red chilies, local grains and gram flour in the preparation of

                        royal setup that recreates the aura of the Kachwaha clan. Lal Maas is the specialty here, which
                        is a curry made with succulent pieces of mutton prepared in yogurt sauce that is infused with
                        the right blend of garlic, red mathania chilies, and other spices. This aromatic gravy goes well
                        with Indian breitems, such as roti and naan. The melt-in-the-mouth desserts served here are
                        definitely worth the visit, while the old-world charm just floors every visitor. So, drop in at

                entice the soul. This is one place you would want to spend your cheat day at!</p>

                    <P>hi… I have gone through most of the above places and I found Rajasthani food actually a best
                        which you can get such delicious taste only in Rajasthan. Such food would definitely take water
                        in your mouth. One of my best recommended hotel for getting experience such delicious taste is
                        Radhey ki haveli. It’s one of the best hotel in khatu.</P>
